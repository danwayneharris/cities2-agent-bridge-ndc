# Command reference — 0.5.0 community

53 commands. Analysis pauses when controls are enabled; otherwise pause manually. Poll asynchronous operation IDs through completion.

Known 0.5.0 issue: named district creation/editing can apply successfully and then report an EntityCommandBuffer naming-notification error. Inspect a fresh atlas and the operation result before any retry. Never replay an uncertain mutation. Boundary edits without a name have completed normally. See RELEASE-NOTES.md.

## District atlas and controls

| Command | Arguments and result |
|---|---|
| `create_district` | `polygon`: 3–64 corners `{x,z}`, optional `name`, optional `apply` (false by default). Native complete-polygon preview; explicit apply is followed by entity/name/boundary readback. Returns an operation ID to poll with `get_operation`. |
| `edit_district` | Live `index`/`version`, `expectedPolygon`, new `polygon`, optional `name` and `apply`. Preserves the original district entity through native recreation. Rejects stale boundary, unintended neighboring changes and mismatched native preview. Returns an operation ID. |
| `get_district_atlas` | Optional `layer`: districts (default), buildings, roads; `offset`, `limit` 1–1024. First call omits `snapshotId` and starts at offset 0 to capture all layers while paused. Continuations supply the returned `snapshotId`. Returns immutable `items`, total/nextOffset/truncated and shared city/frame/time metadata. No geographic projection or personal citizen records. |
| `set_service_districts` | Live building `index`/`version`; `districts` and `expectedDistricts` arrays of district identities. Default preview; `apply:true` changes assignments after control, stale-set and entity validation. Empty list restores citywide service. Returns before/requested/after and direct native-buffer readback status. Does not establish service reach. |


Use `export-atlas.ps1 -Capture -OutputDirectory <new-directory>` for JSON/CSV/Markdown/SVG exports. See [atlas documentation](../atlas/README.md).

Coordinates are game-world metres. Obtain actual positions and IDs through inspection; do not reuse IDs across city sessions. Position objects use `x`, `z`, and optional `y` (terrain height is sampled when absent). Optional `index`/`version` attach a point to a node, edge, or zone block. Edge attachment also requires `curvePosition` between 0 and 1. Prefab arguments use `prefabIndex`/`prefabVersion` from `get_build_prefabs`.

| Command | Arguments and result |
|---|---|
| `ping` | Live connection and mod version. |
| `get_capabilities` | Command groups, build version, control and validation status. |
| `get_city_state` | Population, money, health, happiness, XP, time, simulation speed. |
| `get_city_management` | City state, demand by category, tax rates, households, income/expense breakdowns. Financial source values are reported in native raw units. |
| `get_build_prefabs` | Optional `filter`, `kind`, `offset`, `limit`; paginated assets with IDs, lock status and placement support. See the pagination contract below. |
| `get_prefab_details` | `index`, `version`; known native placement, capacity, and service data fields. |
| `get_services` | Service IDs, budgets, building IDs, workers and workplaces. Check `complete` and `errors` for partial results. |
| `get_buildings` | Optional `filter`, `problemsOnly`, `offset`, `limit`, and spatial `x,z,radius`; paginated building details. Default 512 per page, maximum 4096. Follow `nextOffset` to completion. |
| `diagnose_connections` | Same arguments as `get_buildings`, restricted to detected problems. Null connections and supply shortfalls are distinguished. |
| `get_water_facilities` | Water producers and sewage outlets, positions and production/processing readings. |
| `get_selected` | Inspect the selected entity. |
| `inspect_entity` | `index`, `version`; prefab, position, component names and supported utility readings. |
| `get_network` | `x`, `z`, `radius` ≤1000; nearby nodes and connected edge IDs. |
| `get_network_edges` | `x`, `z`, `radius` ≤2000; curves, endpoint IDs, lengths, prefab names, raw traffic distance/duration counters. |
| `trace_network` | `fromIndex`, `fromVersion`, `toIndex`, `toVersion`; physical graph connectivity and edge path. This does not prove vehicle routability or sufficient utility capacity. |
| `get_zone_cells` | `x`, `z`, `radius` ≤500; optional `offset`, `limit` 1–65536 (default2048). Stable entity-index pagination with `total`, `truncated`, `nextOffset`. |
| `sample_terrain` | `points:[{x,z},…]`, up to 1024; height, normal, water depth/velocity/pollution and ground, air and noise pollution. |
| `get_tiles` | Tile IDs, purchased state, boundary polygons and remaining purchase allowance. |
| `get_camera` | Camera pivot, position, angle and zoom. |
| `set_camera` | Optional `pivot:{x,y,z}`, `zoom`; returns before/after controller targets. |
| `set_simulation_speed` | `speed`: 0, 1, 2, or 4. |
| `build_road` | Prefab IDs, `start`, `end`, `maxCost`; optional `control` for a simple curve, `elevation` offset (−100 to 100). Native snapping, preview, errors, spending check, application and entity verification. |
| `build_network` | Same arguments and pipeline for pipes, power lines and other unlocked placeable network prefabs. Read prefab placement information before choosing elevation. |
| `upgrade_network` | Prefab IDs, target edge `index`/`version`, `maxCost`; native replacement preview and post-application check. |
| `zone_rectangle` | Zone prefab IDs, `start`, `end`, optional `dezone`; native marquee, diagonal ≤500, does not overwrite existing zones. Block-attached start points align the rectangle with that block; otherwise native camera orientation defines the axes. |
| `clear_zoning` | Same arguments as zoning; selects the native dezoning operation. |
| `place_building` | Building prefab IDs, `position`, `rotation` in degrees, `maxCost`. Optional `candidates:[{position,rotation},…]` (1–16), `maxSnapDistance`0–128 (default32), `previewOnly`, `allowDemolition`(defaultfalse). Native preview and bounded candidate retries; expected-prefab/position verification. |
| `relocate_building` | Placement arguments plus `moveIndex`, `moveVersion`; native move mode with a result check. |
| `demolish` | Target `index`, `version`; only buildings/network edges; checks native demolition preview and observed removal. Connected sub-entities may be removed by the game's native operation. |
| `purchase_tiles` | `tiles:[{index,version},…]`, `maxCost`; native selection validation, purchase cost and purchased-state verification. |
| `set_tax` | `area`: Residential, Commercial, Industrial or Office; `rate` −10 to 30. |
| `set_service_budget` | Service prefab IDs, `budget` 50–150. |
| `save_checkpoint` | Optional safe `label`; unique local save through the game’s save system, including preview and metadata; no existing save overwritten. |
| `get_operation` | `id`; queued/validating/applying/complete/failed/interrupted plus results. |
| `batch_execute` | `steps:[{command,args},…]`,1–64; optional `reserve`. Sequential while paused, waits for operations, stops at first failure; spending limits preserve reserve. Overall 600-second deadline. Other batch mutations are rejected while running. |
| `get_batch` | `id`; status, completed count, per-step results and failure index. |

The client also has `stop`, which writes the bridge stop latch. This disables subsequent control and stops construction/batches at their next check. An active bounded simulation step pauses at the next bridge tick. Already-applied changes remain. Remove the STOP file and re-enable the option to resume.

## Full city workflow

1. Discover unlocked prefabs and inspect placement/capacity data.
2. Read purchased land, terrain, existing roads and utility connections.
3. Start a batch with a save checkpoint, then roads/utilities, service facilities and zoning. Every construction step includes its spending limit.
4. Poll the batch result, then inspect actual created entities, connectivity, supply, demand and finances.
5. Advance simulation and reassess capacity and demand before expanding.

Batch example structure (replace IDs/coordinates with queried values before execution):

```json
{"steps":[
  {"command":"save_checkpoint","args":{"label":"before-expansion"}},
  {"command":"build_network","args":{"prefabIndex":123,"prefabVersion":1,"start":{"x":100,"z":100},"end":{"x":200,"z":100},"maxCost":5000}},
  {"command":"place_building","args":{"prefabIndex":456,"prefabVersion":1,"position":{"x":150,"z":120},"rotation":90,"maxCost":50000}}
]}
```

The batch is sequential, not transactional. A later failure leaves earlier successful steps intact. Returned IDs belong to the current city session. Save checkpoints are recoverable through CS2’s normal Load Game menu.

## Verification status

See RELEASE-NOTES.md and VALIDATION.txt for validation scope.

## Added commands

| Command | Arguments and result |
|---|---|
| `pause_for_analysis` | Pause and return comprehensive diagnostics. Requires control. |
| `get_city_diagnostics` | Happiness/demand factors, education/workforce, finances, service capacity/occupancy, persistent shortages and efficiency penalties. |
| `get_city_map` | `x,z,radius`(16–500): footprints, roads, cells, coarse terrain/pollution grid, tiles, frame and paused state. |
| `find_building_sites` | Building prefab IDs, `x,z,radius`(16–500;default150): up to 16 geometric candidates along roads. Native validation still required. |
| `preview_building` | Same arguments as `place_building`; native preview returns cost/snapped position without applying. Requires control because native preview tools activate. |
| `plan_neighborhood` | `maxTotalCost`, optional `reserve`, arrays `roads`, `utilities`, `buildings`, `zones` containing normal command arguments. Optional `grid` below. Returns stored plan ID, steps, cost bounds, errors/warnings. |
| `execute_neighborhood` | `id`: revalidate/submit a stored ready plan with before/after saves. Returns `batch.id`. |
| `get_neighborhood_plan` | `id`: plan and execution state if submitted. |
| `cancel_batch` | Interrupt remaining work. Applied changes remain; an already-running save can finish. |
| `simulate_step` | `frames`1–262144(default4096), `wallSeconds`1–60(default30), `stallSeconds`1–wall(defaultmin(5,wall)), `speed`1/2/4(default4). Optional `cashFloor`, positive `populationChange`, `stopOnDemandChange`, `stopOnConstructionComplete`, `stopOnNewShortage`(defaulttrue), `acknowledgeNoProgress`. Returns immediately with operation ID. |
| `get_simulation_step` | `id`: status poll that does not pause. Finished results contain `reason`, `paused`, `advancedFrames`, `before`, `after`, `delta`, `elapsedSeconds`, `stagnantSteps`, `reassessmentRequired`. Snapshot failure/city change can omit `after`; check `snapshotError` and `paused`. |
| `cancel_simulation_step` | Pause/end the active step without disabling controls. |

`grid` fields: `x,z`, `columns,rows`1–4, `blockWidth,blockDepth`64–200metres, `roadPrefabIndex,roadPrefabVersion`, `zonePrefabIndex,zonePrefabVersion`, `maxCostPerRoad`. Grid coordinates are world-aligned. Explicit roads can connect to the existing city; service buildings/utilities belong in the same plan. Total generated plus explicit steps must be 1–62, leaving room for two saves. Zones retain native marquee semantics; block-attached starts give exact orientation.

`spendingUpperBound` sums supplied per-step maximums; it is not an exact native quote. It must fit `maxTotalCost` and treasury minus reserve. `knownBuildingBaseCost` uses native prefab base costs; network costs are confirmed during preview. Footprint screening does not model every sub-object, curved road, terrain constraint or infrastructure connection.

Recommended loop:

```powershell
.\bridge.ps1 pause_for_analysis
.\export-map.ps1 -X -1600 -Z 500 -Radius 400
# Analyze, plan, execute, then wait for the batch to finish while paused.
.\advance.ps1 -Frames 4096 -WallSeconds 20 -PopulationChange 50
# The final snapshot is taken after pausing. Analyze before the next action.
```

`advance.ps1` never automatically retries simulation. On a client deadline it requests cancellation once and reports if pause cannot be confirmed. A fully hung game thread cannot execute its watchdog until it resumes; the independent client deadline prevents indefinite waiting.

# Visibility changes in 0.4.3

- `get_buildings` and `diagnose_connections`: optional `offset` (default0), `limit` (default512, max4096), and spatial `x,z,radius` together (radius >0, <=14000). Existing `filter` and `problemsOnly` remain. Results are sorted by entity index/version and include `total`, `truncated`, `nextOffset`, `citySession`. Follow `nextOffset` until null while the city stays paused; abandon collected pages when the city session changes. Road-disconnection warnings now require the prefab's RequireRoad flag.
- `get_build_prefabs`: optional `kind` (`building`, `network`, `zone`, `service`, `tree`, `prop`, `surface`, `other`, `all`), `filter`, `offset`, `limit` (default4096, max20000). Default includes known categories; `all` includes internal prefab types too. Includes pagination metadata, `prefabType` and `bridgePlacementSupported`. Discovery does not imply supported placement; `locked` still applies.
- `get_services`: service-prefab type guard; per-service exceptions appear in `errors` with `complete:false` instead of losing the whole response. Never interpret partial results as complete service coverage.
- `get_capabilities`: explicit visibility coverage and relevant loaded assembly versions. Assembly presence does not prove successful mod initialization. Traffic lane-rule, full Building Use metrics and Road Builder configuration adapters remain unsupported.
- City state's `dateMeaning` warns that raw simulation datetime differs from the displayed calendar. The existing `date` field is retained for compatibility, not corrected to a guessed calendar.

## Staged terrain/resource sampling in 0.4.4

`sample_terrain` keeps its existing `points` input (1–1024 world positions). `get_city_map.terrain` uses the same sampler. No new command, simulation step, construction, or forced GPU readback is involved.

- Water depth, pollution and flow use `WaterSystem.GetSurfaceData`, the full-precision surface, instead of the separate downscaled flow reader. Existing `waterDepth`, `waterPollution` and `waterVelocity` fields remain; inspect `waterStatus` (`ok`, `unavailable`, `out_of_bounds`, `invalid`). Unknown/invalid water values are null, not zero. Depth is metres; pollution is a native sampled value, not a percentage; velocity is native world-space flow, not independently verified metres per second.
- `naturalResourcesStatus` and `naturalResources` add fertility, ore, oil and fish. Each resource has `baseRaw`, `usedRaw` and `availableRaw = max(0, baseRaw - usedRaw)`. These are native quantities, not percentages or guaranteed output. Read the whole proposed extraction area, not just its centre.
- `groundwaterStatus` and `groundwater` add `amountRaw`, `maxRaw`, `pollutedRaw`, and `pollutionFraction` (polluted / amount). The fraction is null when the amount is zero or the ratio is invalid; an empty aquifer is not a clean-water supply. Invalid raw groundwater values are retained for diagnosis with status `invalid`.
- Resource and groundwater reads use the containing native map cell and include `cellIndex`. Response `sampling` metadata supplies map size and cell size; the inspected 1.6.2f1 maps have 56-metre cells across a centred 14,336-metre square. The negative map edge is included and the positive edge excluded. Exterior points return null resource/groundwater objects and `out_of_bounds`, never fabricated edge-cell readings.
- Missing maps return `unavailable`. A real zero resource result has status `ok`. Buffers are read after completing native writer dependencies; water is the latest completed asynchronous CPU readback, not a promise of same-frame GPU data. Keep analysis paused and inspect `citySession`.

Offline checks cannot validate the live overlay correspondence or water appearance. Before relying on 0.4.4 for site selection, compare dry land, shoreline and open water; fertility/ore/oil/fish areas; and groundwater quantity/pollution against the native game overlays.

## Development junction diagnostics
`get_junction_snapshot`: live node `index`/`version`; manually paused only, never auto-pauses. See [snapshot contract](JUNCTION-SNAPSHOTS.md).

`get_junction_preview`: permanent node index/version; manually paused read-only
observation of matching temporary junctions. Not an Apply validation verdict.
See [preview contract](JUNCTION-SNAPSHOTS.md#preview-observations).

## NetworkTools development adapter (Debug builds only)

These commands require a loaded, paused city and the matching local NetworkTools Debug build. Mutations require enabled bridge controls and respect STOP. They do not enable a disabled mod in the playset; `nt_activate` activates its Smooth Curve tool.

| Command | Arguments and result |
|---|---|
| `nt_get_state` | Read tool session, revision, submission, phase, endpoints, strength and previewReady. |
| `nt_activate` | Activate Smooth Curve. Poll state before selecting. |
| `nt_clear` | Current `session`, `revision`; clear selection. |
| `nt_select` | Current `session`, `revision`, `start` and `end` objects with live `index`/`version`. Requires Idle; uses existing path selection, maximum 128 nodes. |
| `nt_strength` | Current `session`, `revision`, numeric `value` in [0,1]. |
| `nt_apply` | Current `session`, `revision`, `submission`. Requires verified current preview. Acceptance is NOT completion; independently inspect permanent geometry afterward. |

Read state after each operation. Never reuse entity identities across city loads. Clear explicitly before replacing an existing selection. Poll previewReady before Apply. Missing Debug adapter is an explicit error; advertised commands alone do not prove an installed adapter.

Split-point development extension: `nt_split` takes current `session`, `revision`,
`node:{index,version}` and boolean `enabled`. Only non-junction interior nodes in
an active ready Smooth Curve selection are eligible. Read `splitChoices` from
`nt_get_state` for fresh candidates. Each change invalidates the preview. Clear,
path extension and trimming clear split choices. A split fixes node position and
aligns its planar join at every strength including zero; it does not guarantee
vertical tangent or curvature continuity. Not yet live-verified.

| Command | Arguments and result |
|---|---|
| `nt_split` | Current tool token, `node` identity, `enabled` boolean; toggles an eligible split constraint. |
